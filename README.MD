#AutoUpdater
This is a small fun project I wanted to make to see how the commons compress library works. So far the program downloads what ever url is in the url.txt file and saves it as what ever is the second line in url.txt
I plan on updating this to work with other projects I make.

###Contributors OR anything else
Feel free to use this how ever you want, I would really appreciate to know how it works for you or if anything here could be improved. I had a lot of fun making this.
